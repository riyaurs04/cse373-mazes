# CSE 373 - Mazes

This is one of the projects I worked on as part of the coursework for CSE 373 (Data Structures and Algorithms) at the University of Washington. 

In this project, I developed a maze generation and solving application using optimized data structures. I implemented Kruskalâ€™s algorithm with union-by-size and path compression to ensure solvability and efficiency in complex mazes.
